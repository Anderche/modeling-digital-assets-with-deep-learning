A Comparative Study of Multivariate Macroeconomic Features for Modeling Digital Assets with Deep Learning Algorithms_30Aug2022.ipynb

### Abstract:
Investing in the markets - from the stock market to cryptocurrencies - is often dubious speculation on the part of investors. Time-series forecasting has long been a popular topic in terms of investing, and deep learning has recently been applied for modeling and predicting financial asset prices. However, utilizing deep learning in financial modeling presents several challenges. Macroeconomic factors driven by natural disasters, global conflicts and other events can substantially affect any assetâ€™s price movement. These factors and their correlations to an asset are dynamic leading markets to be characterized as irrational and unpredictable. Deep learning - a subset of the larger artificial intelligence field - is similarly characterized as a blackbox that can uncover unforeseen patterns from data. This research will be a comparison study of LSTM and GRU algorithms and a feature analysis of multivariate macroeconomic features pertaining to their capacity to improve accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions.
